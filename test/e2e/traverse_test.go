// M28 acceptance (SPEC §11, ADR-054), fully offline: a type is a file and a
// run is a sequence of typed legs. A person pipeline traverses to posts
// from a fixture adapter, writes authored_by per post, coalesces the post two
// parents share, counts parents in/empty and children traversed/coalesced,
// and ends in a group typed post; a second traverse back to people reaches a
// person already in the run and coalesces; sql/traverse follows works_at to
// the companies of the run's people; the plan shows every type change; a
// cross-segment when: is refused naming the traverse; once: treats a parent
// that reached a traverse as finished; a dry run executes the crossing.
