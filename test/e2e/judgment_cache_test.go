// M16 acceptance (SPEC §11, ADR-039): the judgment cache. A re-run with an
// unchanged prompt and inputs dispatches nothing (every record skipped with
// reason same_judgment, verdicts re-applied); changing the prompt re-judges
// all; changing one input re-judges one; cache: 1d past the window
// re-judges; respend: true re-judges; provenance carries the signature; the
// AI respend warning is gone; --simulate cache-skips; a deferred step
// cache-checks before submitting.
