// Package all imports every built-in adapter for its registration side effect.
// Anything that resolves adapters by id (the CLI) imports this package; the
// adapter packages themselves stay free of import cycles. It also wires the
// binding tier (SPEC §10a) into the adapter registry: the embedded built-in
// bindings, and the loader that lets external binding.yaml directories resolve
// like any other adapter.
