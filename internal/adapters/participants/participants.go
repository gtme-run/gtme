// Package participants registers the runner-owned participant adapters

// their agent/* aliases. They exist as manifests — so `gtme plan` resolves
// them, `gtme help --agent` lists them, and the planner applies the
// participant-role grammar (uses:, provides:, of:) exactly as it does for
// ai/* — but no protocol session is ever opened: the runner asks at a
// terminal, or the records wait in the ledger for `gtme answer`. The one
// implementation lives in internal/participant and the runner.
