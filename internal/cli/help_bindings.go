const bindingsNote = "A binding is a declarative adapter (SPEC §10a): one binding.yaml, validated against `schema` below, plus fixtures/conformance.json beside it, interpreted by the engine — data, not code; it cannot execute anything and no expression language exists inside it. It declares the same manifest surface as a process adapter (id, version, role, entity_type, needs/provides, config_schema, credentials, freshness_days), so `gtme plan` treats both tiers identically. Binding roles are source (pagination + cursor), traverse (ADR-054: a source-shaped request templated per parent from `{{record.<field>}}` placeholders, which are also its needs; declares `from` — the input type — and `relation: {name, from: record|parent}`, the edge written between each emitted record and its parent; `entity_type` is the OUTPUT type, and the binding MAY ship the type it emits as `types/<name>.json` beside binding.yaml, read in place — never an embedded name), enrich (one request per record) and deliver (idempotency + dry-run receipts). The moment a binding needs logic — conditionals, multi-call workflows, OAuth dances, request signing, computation — it graduates to a process adapter: a directory holding manifest.json + an executable named `run` speaking the §5 NDJSON protocol (`gtme help --agent` documents that surface). To add an adapter: write the YAML against `schema`, model it on `reference`, record one real response per request as fixtures, place the directory on `discovery.path`, and `gtme plan` resolves `use: <id>` like a built-in. Costs (ADR-046): declare `cost` honestly — `amount_usd` is a number, or a template resolved from config (`\"{{config.cost_per_record_usd}}\"`, with the knob declared in `config_schema`) wherever the vendor's price depends on the operator's plan; an unset template runs at $0 and `gtme plan` prints `est/record: unset`. Every binding-engine cost is `estimated` (a rate multiplied out); `measured` is reserved for vendor-reported cost metadata, which only a process adapter can read. A page-billed endpoint declares `per: request` — `per: record` counts emitted records, and a `limit` truncates emission after the vendor has billed the whole page. Limit (ADR-047): on a `role: source` binding, config `limit` is a reserved engine key that caps emitted records and stops pagination at the cap; the engine accepts it whether or not `config_schema` declares it (a strict `additionalProperties: false` schema need not list it), and a binding that does declare it receives it unchanged for its own templates."
