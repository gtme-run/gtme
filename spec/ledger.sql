-- spec/ledger.sql — the canonical gtme ledger schema (SPEC.md §3, DECIDED).
--
-- This file is the machine-checkable form of SPEC.md §3, per ADR-010. It is
-- transcribed verbatim from that section and MUST stay identical to it. Running
-- it against an empty SQLite database produces the canonical schema:
--
--   sqlite3 canonical.db < spec/ledger.sql
--
-- The Go test suite applies it to a fresh in-memory database and compares the
-- resulting object names against a ledger opened through the real migration
-- path (internal/ledger). Implementations MAY add tables the spec does not name
-- (they are spec-invisible per ADR-010's litmus); they MUST NOT omit anything
-- defined here.

-- The current-value projection (ADR-003) is two views, not one: "highest
-- confidence within the freshness window" (SPEC §3) cannot be answered by an
-- unparameterized view, because the window is a per-caller argument (SPEC

-- one definition of the RANKING rule (confidence DESC, ties broken by newest
-- created_at); current_fields is that ranking with no window applied
-- (rank = 1) — the plain `gtme query` answer. The runner's windowed
-- projection (internal/ledger/project.go) reads field_value_ranks directly
-- and takes the first in-window row per field, falling through a stale
-- top-ranked row to the next-best one — the same ranking, just windowed
