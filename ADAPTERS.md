# Adapters

Every adapter that ships with gtme, what it does, and the config that
matters. Three always-true companions to this page: `gtme help --agent`
regenerates the full surface (every manifest, every flag) from the live
registry, `gtme help --bindings` prints the contract for authoring a
binding gtme does not ship, and each adapter's contract lives in its
manifest or binding —
this page is the human-readable tour, not a second source of truth.

Three kinds appear below:

- **binding** — pure YAML interpreted by the generic engine
  (`spec/bindings/`); cannot execute code; ships conformance fixtures that
  `--simulate` serves.
- **process** — a Go (or any-language) executable speaking NDJSON; used
  where an integration needs real logic.
- **runner-owned** — not an adapter at all: the runner executes it
  directly against the ledger (SQL steps, group sources). Listed here
  because you `use:` them the same way.

| id | role | kind | what it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `csv/source` | source | process (built-in) | rows from a CSV, with `columns:` ingress mapping |
| `demo/enrich` | enrich | process (built-in) | synthetic, keyless, priced at a stated pretend rate — the zero-key cache demo |
| `source: {group: …}` | source | runner-owned | a typed group's current members, projected from the ledger |
| `apollo/search` | source | **binding** | Apollo people search, paginated |
| `harvest/profile` | enrich | process (built-in) | LinkedIn profile via HarvestAPI |
| `http/enrich` | enrich | engine-inline | fetch any URL per record → markdown field or JSON extraction |
| `sql/traverse` | traverse | runner-owned | follow a relation the ledger already holds into records of another type |
| `sql/transform` | enrich | runner-owned | derive fields with a read-only SELECT over the ledger — per-record or cross-record |
| `ai/filter` | filter | process (built-in) | LLM judgment → pass/fail verdicts with reasons |
| `sql/filter` | filter | runner-owned | deterministic verdicts from a SQL predicate |
| `ai/compose` | compose | process (built-in) | LLM writing → `first_line`, `ps_line`, or whatever the step's `provides:` declares |
| `instantly/add-to-campaign` | deliver | process (built-in) | add a lead to an Instantly campaign |
| `attio/assert` | deliver | **binding** | idempotent upsert of a person into Attio |
| `group/deliver` | deliver | runner-owned | hand records to a group — the next stage's source (ADR-032) |
| `http/deliver` | deliver | engine-inline | POST resolved variables to any URL |
| `csv/deliver` | deliver | process (built-in) | append delivered records to a reviewable CSV |
| `mock-enrich-py` | enrich | process (external, Python) | example proving the any-language adapter boundary |

## How adapters work

Every adapter — binding or process — presents the same three things to the
runner: a **contract** (`needs`/`provides` as JSON Schema over canonical
field names), a **config schema** (what its `with:` block accepts), and a
**role** (source, traverse, enrich, filter, verify, compose, review,
deliver). That's all
`gtme plan` sees, which is why it can validate a whole pipeline without
caring how any step is implemented. At run time the runner projects
exactly the declared fields into the adapter, validates whatever comes
back against `provides` and the registry, and writes it to the ledger —
adapters never touch storage and never see more than their projection.

Most adapters are **bindings**: the entire implementation is a YAML
document the engine interprets. Here's a complete, working one — the
source adapter from the
[getting-started tutorial](https://www.elegantatomics.com/blog/getting-started-with-gtme),
annotated:

```yaml
id: jsonplaceholder/users     # how pipelines name it: use: jsonplaceholder/users
version: 1
role: source                  # source | traverse | enrich | deliver
entity_type: person

provides:                     # the contract — plan validates downstream
  type: object                # steps against exactly these fields
  additionalProperties: false
  properties:
    full_name: { type: string }
    email: { type: string }
    company_name: { type: string }
    company_domain: { type: string }
    jsonplaceholder.username: { type: string }   # vendor-namespaced: not canonical

config_schema:                # what `with:` accepts, validated at plan time
  type: object
  properties:
    limit: { type: integer, minimum: 1 }
    base_url: { type: string, default: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com" }

request:                      # templated from config + (for enrich/deliver)
  method: GET                 # the record's own fields: {{record.email}} etc.
  url: "{{config.base_url}}/users"

extract:                      # response → canonical records
  records: "."                # dotted path to the record array
  fields:
    full_name: name                                    # plain path
    email: { path: email, transform: email }           # registry rule: lowercase + validate
    company_name: company.name                         # paths walk nested objects
    company_domain: { path: website, transform: domain } # rule: reduce to eTLD+1
    jsonplaceholder.username: username
```

Real vendors add the remaining primitives, declared the same way: `auth`
(where the credential goes and which env var holds it), `pagination`
(strategy, termination, page size), `errors` (status → verdict),
`idempotency: native | ledger` for deliver bindings, `cost`, and `retry`.
That's the whole vocabulary — about eight primitives, pinned by
[`spec/binding-schema.json`](spec/binding-schema.json). What a binding
deliberately *cannot* do is express logic: no conditionals, no
expressions, no multi-call flows. The `transform:` hook only accepts
named registry rules, so all judgment is frozen at authoring time and a
binding is safe to review by reading it.

The lifecycle: drop the file (plus `fixtures/conformance.json`, a saved
real response) into `~/.gtme/adapters/<name>/` and the id resolves
immediately — no build, no restart. The fixtures are the adapter's
conformance test *and* what `--simulate` serves, so a new adapter is
provable offline before its first live call.

When an integration genuinely needs logic — HarvestAPI's second
posts-call, Instantly's campaign-name resolution — it **graduates to a
process adapter**: an executable in any language reading NDJSON on stdin
and writing it on stdout (`OPEN` → `RECORD`s → `END`, spec'd in SPEC §5
with schemas in `spec/schemas/`), with a `manifest.json` declaring the
same contract surface. Same protocol as the built-ins, same conformance
bar, ~40 lines in Python for the shipped example
([`adapters/mock-enrich-py/`](adapters/mock-enrich-py/)).

## Universal per-step knobs

Universal knobs that work on (nearly) every step, regardless of adapter:
`cache: Nd` overrides the freshness window; `when: <step>.passed` gates on
a filter; `require:`/`exclude:` gate on group membership; deliver steps
take `variables:` (egress mapping), `idempotency:`, `on_missing:
skip|fail`, `record:` (touch scope), and `suppress: {group, within}`;
participant steps (ai/*, human/*, agent/*) take `on_missing:
run|skip|fail` for a `uses:` field absent at run time (ADR-053 — `run`,
the default, dispatches anyway and the receipt counts it). A field-writing
step that advances a record without writing anything counts it `empty`
on the receipt, not `out`.

---

## Sources

### `csv/source`

Reads a CSV; the header row becomes field names. `columns:` maps canonical
names → your headers (`full_name: "Full Name"`); headers that already
match canonical names auto-map; near-misses are suggested at plan time,
never guessed. Unmapped headers are kept, namespaced `csv.<header>`.
Values are normalized at ingress (emails lowercased, domains reduced to
eTLD+1); a value that fails its rule is dropped from that record with the
reason recorded — never a crash. A mapping that yields no identity-key
path (person: no email, no LinkedIn URL, no name) is a plan error.

```yaml
source:
  use: csv/source
  with:
    path: contacts.csv
    columns: { full_name: Full Name, email: Email, company_domain: Company Website }
```

### Events without a daemon

There is no `webhook/source` (ADR-055 defers it to the roadmap; it returns
with `listen`). The working recipe: a commodity receiver (a Cloudflare
Worker, Zapier, a GitHub Action) appends each event as a row to a CSV,
and a scheduled `gtme run` sources it with `csv/source`. Rows re-source
on every run; identity coalescing, the judgment cache and delivery
idempotency keep that cheap and safe.

### Group as a source

```yaml
source:
  group: q3-qualified
```

No adapter, no `use:` — the runner projects the group's current members
straight from the ledger. The consuming half of the qualify/send
decomposition. The group must exist at plan time.

A group carries the entity type of its members (ADR-054), set when it is
created — by the terminus or `group/deliver` that first wrote to it, or
by `gtme groups add NAME --type TYPE` — and adding a member of another
type is refused. The pipeline takes that type, so field names after a
group source are validated like anywhere else. A group created before
types existed has none, and a pipeline sourcing from it is entity-blind
until `--type` sets it; `gtme plan` says so.

### `apollo/search` — binding

Apollo `mixed_people/search`, paginated, mapped to canonical fields —
including the judgment calls: LinkedIn URLs routed by shape
(public/internal/sales-nav), Apollo's locked-email placeholder treated as
absent (never an identity key), domain fallback from `primary_domain` to
`website_url`. Config: `query` or `titles`/`seniorities`/`locations`/
`domains`, plus `limit`. Credential: `APOLLO_API_KEY`. The whole adapter
is [~150 lines of YAML](spec/bindings/apollo-search/binding.yaml).

## Traversers

A traverse changes the run's entity type: records of one type in, records
of another — or the same — type out, each related to the record that
produced it (ADR-054). Only the new type moves forward; the parents are
finished at the traverse. So a pipeline is a sequence of typed segments,
every step is validated against the type of its segment, and `when:` may
only name a step in the same one — gate at the traverse itself to skip a
parent's children. `gtme plan` prints each crossing with the relation it
writes. A vendor traverse fetches records the ledger has never seen;
`sql/traverse` follows edges it already holds.

### `sql/traverse`

The runner-owned traverse: one read-only, timeboxed SELECT yielding
`identity_id` (the children, of the step's declared `entity_type`) and
`parent_id` (the run's current records). It follows a relation the ledger
already holds, so it mints nothing, writes no relation, and costs
nothing.

```yaml
- id: to-company
  use: sql/traverse
  with:
    entity_type: company
    query: >
      SELECT r.to_id AS identity_id, r.from_id AS parent_id
      FROM relations r WHERE r.relation = 'works_at'
```

### A vendor traverse

Records that are not in the ledger yet have to be fetched, so a vendor
traverse is source-shaped with two additions: `from:` (the input type,
which must equal the segment it sits in) and `relation:` (the edge
written between each emitted record and its parent, and which end it
starts at). Its request templates per parent from `{{record.<field>}}`
placeholders, which are also its needs; `entity_type:` is the type it
*emits*; `limit:` caps children per parent. A binding may ship the type
it emits as `types/<name>.json` beside `binding.yaml`, read in place —
never one of the names the binary embeds. gtme ships no vendor traverse
today; `gtme help --bindings` is the contract to author one against.

---

## Enrichers

### `demo/enrich`

The binary's own synthetic enrichment (ADR-056), so the zero-key path can
print the top-up receipt on a ledger that persists — which `--simulate`,
running against a throwaway copy, cannot. Needs `email` or `full_name`;
provides `demo.score` (0–100, derived from the identity key's hash, so
deterministic) and `demo.note` (always `synthetic — demo/enrich called no
vendor`). No key, no network, no payload; runs the same armed and under
`--simulate`. Priced at config `cost_per_record_usd` (default $0.01) as an
*estimated* COST under provider `demo`, so the receipt's arithmetic is
real over a stated pretend price and the adapter id labels every dollar
it produces; 30-day freshness, `cache:` overrides. Never in the registry
index, and the `demo/` prefix is refused for installed bindings.
`examples/cache.yaml` runs it twice for the delta.

### `harvest/profile`

LinkedIn profile lookup via HarvestAPI. Needs *any one* LinkedIn URL shape
(public, internal, or Sales Navigator); when the lookup starts from a
non-public shape it also returns the resolved public `linkedin_url`, which
upgrades the identity key automatically. Provides headline, about,
location, role history, current role/company, and (config `posts_limit`)
recent posts. Credential: `HARVEST_API_KEY`; ~$0.012/profile; 30-day
freshness by default. Stays a process adapter on purpose: the posts call
and role-history formatting are logic a binding refuses to hold.

### `http/enrich`

The generic fetch enricher — the binding engine invoked inline. Two modes:
`markdown: true` + `field:` fetches a page and stores it as markdown under
your declared field; `extract:` maps a JSON response by dotted paths.
`freshness_days` is **required** (web content rots) and doubles as the
cache window — N AI steps across M runs reuse one fetch. `{{record.x}}`
placeholders in the URL are the step's plan-checked needs. 256 KB response
cap (oversized = dropped, never truncated); no-JS fetching only; raw
responses retained as payloads under the retention declaration.

```yaml
- id: fetch
  use: http/enrich
  with:
    url: "https://{{record.company_domain}}"
    markdown: true
    field: web.homepage
    freshness_days: 7
```

### `sql/transform`

Deterministic derivation in the ledger's own language. One read-only,
timeboxed SELECT per step; declared contracts (`uses:` and `provides:` in
config — never parsed from the SQL); results must include an
`identity_id` column and apply only to the run's records. Derived values
append like any adapter output, provenance `sql/transform @ <query-hash>`.

```yaml
- id: bucket
  use: sql/transform
  with:
    uses: [title]
    provides: [sql.seniority_bucket]
    query: >
      SELECT identity_id, CASE WHEN ... END AS "sql.seniority_bucket"
      FROM current_fields WHERE field = 'title'
```

## Filters

### `ai/filter`

Batches records into one model call (default 25/batch) and returns
per-record verdicts with reasons — which land in the ledger, so prompt
tuning is a SQL query over what the model actually decided. The prompt
is `template:` (ADR-057) — a string or `{file: path}`, rendered once
over `config.*` (the step's own `with:` keys, so a persona lives in a
file and a pipeline names it); records never enter the text, they arrive
as the fenced payload, so `record.*` there is a plan error. Declare the
fields the prompt reads with `uses:`; they're plan-checked. The engine
is the Anthropic Messages API (ADR-050: there is no `engine:` key — an
`agent/*` step is how an agent answers instead), model overridable per
step; provenance records the model id. Credential: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

A filter MAY also declare output fields with a step-level `provides:`
(ADR-033) — a list of names, or a map of name → `{type, enum}`:

```yaml
  - id: judge
    use: ai/filter
    uses: [title, company_name]
    provides:
      state: {enum: [now, later]}
      rationale: {}
    with:
      template: Decide when to work each contact, and why.
```

The required output shape in the prompt is generated from that schema;
the model's answer is validated against it (a value outside the enum is
retried once, then fails the batch — never stored); and the step emits
its VERDICT *and* a RECORD carrying the declared fields, for passing and
failing records alike, so the reasoning is queryable without a second
call. Declared fields land namespaced by pipeline — `qualify.state`,
`qualify.rationale` for a pipeline named `qualify` — so two campaigns'
judgments about one identity never collide; a later step reads them as
`uses: [qualify.state]`. A name written with a dot is kept as written.
To write a canonical field instead (global, shared across campaigns —
`first_line`, say, so a deliver step's `variables:` keep reaching it),
mark it `canonical: true`; the plan checks the name, type and domain
against the registry.
AI steps are entity-agnostic (`"entity_type": "*"` in the manifest — any
adapter may declare it): inside a company pipeline they plan and validate
against the company registry.

**Never judged twice by accident (ADR-039).** Every AI step caches: a
record whose *question* (adapter, model, prompt, output shape, `uses:`)
and *facts* (the fields the judgment reads — the `uses:` fields, or the
projection minus the step's own outputs) match a stored judgment is
skipped (`skipped_cache`, reason `same_judgment`); a filter's verdict is
re-applied, a compose's fields are already current. No clock by default:
a changed prompt, model, or input re-judges on its own; `cache: Nd`
bounds reuse for a prompt that reads the clock; `respend: true` (or
`cache: 0d`) asks again. Provenance names the question:
`ai/compose @ <model>#<signature>`.

**Deferred, at half price (ADR-038).** `with: {deferred: true}` on an AI
step sends its batch to the Message Batches API (one request per record,
`custom_id` = identity key, the shared prompt cached across them) and
ends the run **`pending`** — the step must be the pipeline's last, so its
judgment lands in the `group:` terminus and a consumer pipeline pulls it.
The next `gtme run` of the pipeline collects (still processing → still
pending; run again later, from cron or by hand — nothing waits). Under
`--simulate` the step answers synchronously and says so. `gtme plan` warns when a judgment step
has nothing remembering its answers (add `exclude:` naming a group the
pipeline writes, or say `respend: true`).

**Prompt assembly (ADR-035).** The operator's prompt goes first, then the
batch — one compact JSON line per record, long lines wrapped at
structural breaks. Fields the pipeline *fetched* from the outside world
(`http/enrich` pages, provider bios; the runner knows from provenance)
leave the JSON line and arrive as a delimited block labelled in-band as
subject-supplied data, with any delimiter inside the page neutralised
first — so a homepage that says "ignore your instructions" reads as
evidence, not task. Default on; `with: {fence: false}` opts out. The
prompt/records split is exposed to the engine so a cache breakpoint sits
between them (the API engine caches the shared half).

Write queries against the vocabulary views — `current_values` (current
value per field, JSON unwrapped) and `group_membership` (membership by
`group_name`) — rather than the raw tables; `gtme plan` runs `EXPLAIN` so
an unknown column fails before anything runs, and annotates a query that
joins `relations` or membership as *cross-record* (it may read any
identity; only its results are run-scoped, and it recomputes every run).
Any value under any step's `with:` may be `{query: SQL}` or `{segment:
NAME}`, resolved read-only at plan (rows shown; zero rows is an error)
and recorded in the run. `gtme help --agent` carries the read surface and
the canonical query shapes.

### `sql/filter`

Same mechanism as `sql/transform`, producing verdicts: return a `pass`
column (with optional `reason`) to judge explicitly, or just return the
passing `identity_id`s — returned passes, absent fails, predicate named
in the reason. Closes the "has replied ever" / "3+ known contacts at this
company" cases without AI spend. Runs under `--simulate` (it's offline by
construction).

## Composers

### `ai/compose`

Batched LLM writing: provides `first_line` and `ps_line` by default, or
whatever the step's `provides:` declares (ADR-033 — same declaration,
same namespacing and validation as `ai/filter` above; a compose declaring
`provides: [subject, body]` in pipeline `outreach` writes
`outreach.subject` and `outreach.body` and nothing else; `provides:
{first_line: {canonical: true}, subject: {}}` writes canonical
`first_line` beside `outreach.subject`). Output is
validated against the schema with one retry on malformed output. `uses:`
declares what the prompt may reference — including fields `http/enrich`
fetched, which is how compose gets grounded in a prospect's actual
website.

### `text/compose`

The template renderer (ADR-057): a compose with no model and no one
behind it. `template:` is rendered once per record over `record.*` (the
`uses:`/`of:` fields; a namespaced field reads as `record.ns.name`) and
`config.*` (the step's own `with:` keys), and the result is the one field
`provides:` declares. Deterministic, free, no credential; runs identically
under `--simulate`; cached like any judgment (an unchanged record under an
unchanged template is skipped); provenance `text/compose @ #<sig>`. A
render that is empty after trimming writes nothing and the record
continues — a later step's `needs` decide what that means.

```yaml
  - id: subject
    use: text/compose
    uses: [first_name, company_name, recent_posts]
    provides: [subject]
    with:
      template: |
        {{ record.first_name | default: "there" }}, a note for {{ record.company_name }}
        {%- for post in record.recent_posts limit:1 %} — saw "{{ post | truncate: 40 }}"{% endfor %}
```

The dialect is a bounded Liquid, shared by every `template:` in gtme:
`if`/`elsif`/`else`/`unless`/`case`/`when`, `for` (with `limit`,
`offset`, `reversed`), `comment`, `raw`; filters `default`, `truncate`,
`truncatewords`, `size`, `first`, `last`, `join`, `upcase`, `downcase`,
`capitalize`, `strip`, `date`. Nothing else — no `assign`, no `include`
— and the planner refuses an unknown tag or filter, a `record.*` field
outside `uses:`, or a `config.*` key absent from `with:`. A template
shapes text and gates nothing: a comparison that encodes judgment ("is
this a large account") belongs upstream as a labelled field from a
review, which the template then tests. `template: {file: path}` loads
the text from a file beside the pipeline — its bytes join the judgment
signature and travel in a bundle.

## Deliverers

All deliver steps share the runner's guarantees: `variables:` egress
mapping, `on_missing` completeness (blank merge fields never send),
idempotency via the `deliveries` table, dry-run receipts, `record:` touch
scoping, and `suppress:` windows.

**The target is checked before anything sends (ADR-040).** An adapter
whose manifest declares `preflights: true` is asked, at `--dry-run` and at
the start of an armed run, whether the live target is fit to send to —
read-only, once per run, before any record. `ok` proceeds; `inconclusive`
(the target could not be read) proceeds with a warning; **`blocked`
fails the step before a single record moves** — records stay put, the run
finishes `failed`, `--resume` after the fix preflights again. The checks
come from the step's own `variables:`; nothing to configure;
`preflight: false` in adapter config skips. This is the class of failure
attestation cannot see: every request succeeds and nothing meaningful
sends. `gtme plan` stays zero-network. Instantly is the first preflighting
adapter: campaign Active, sequence step count vs the highest `_step_N`
among the targets, every target referenced as `{{name}}` in some step,
no A/B variant lacking one.

**A 2xx is not a delivery (ADR-036).** Every delivery lands `accepted` —
the provider took the request. `sent` is written only when a provider
attests execution (the `listen` verb, not built). An adapter whose
manifest declares `attests: true` re-reads what it just wrote and emits a
three-way verdict per record: `confirmed` (every non-blank field sent is
stored), `contradicted` (a stored value disagrees — the record fails; the
row is kept, marked, so nothing re-sends into a duplicate), or
`inconclusive` (the re-read failed or the shape was unrecognised — the
record advances, `accepted`, and the receipt names it). The receipt and
`gtme show` carry the status. Instantly is the first attesting adapter.

### `instantly/add-to-campaign`

Adds a lead to an Instantly campaign. Accepts a campaign *name* (resolved
to an id once per run — a deliberate process-adapter extra) or the id
itself. `variables:` targets matching Instantly's first-class lead fields
(`first_name`, `last_name`, `company_name`, `personalization`) map into
the lead body; anything else becomes a custom variable. Preflights: reads
the campaign (`GET /api/v2/campaigns/{id}`) and checks status, step count,
variable references and variants before sending. Attests: after the
create it re-reads the lead (`GET /api/v2/leads/{id}`) and compares every
field it sent. Credential: `INSTANTLY_API_KEY`.

### `attio/assert` — binding

Asserts (upserts) a person into Attio by `matching_attribute` (default
`email_addresses`) — **idempotency is native**: re-delivering cannot
duplicate. `variables:` become attribute values on the record. Config:
`object` (default `people`). Credential: `ATTIO_API_KEY`. Pure YAML:
[spec/bindings/attio-assert/](spec/bindings/attio-assert/binding.yaml).

### `group/deliver` — the handoff (ADR-032)

Runner-owned, like the SQL steps: no adapter, no network. `use:
group/deliver` with `with: {group: <name>}` delivers each record *to a
group*, created on demand — the way one pipeline commits records to the
next stage under the same gate a send gets: `--dry-run` receipts the
resolved `variables:` per record for review, arming commits, delivery
idempotency (`group:<name>` is the target scope) means nothing is handed
off twice, and `suppress:`/`on_missing:`/`record:`/`require:`/`exclude:`
all apply. A pipeline may carry several. A group with no consumer is a
hold; release is `gtme groups add`, rejection `gtme groups remove --note
"why"`, review `gtme groups show`. Nothing runs the consumer — it pulls on
its own schedule, and a group source takes `limit: N` (oldest-added
first) to bound a day's work. One commit point per pipeline: `gtme plan`
warns when a handoff and a network-side deliver share one, because arming
approves both.

### `http/deliver`

POST the resolved variables to any URL — the universal Out. The default
body is the variables object; a `body:` template overrides; `auth:` in
config resolves through the same credential machinery as everything else.
The step-level `idempotency:` key is **required** — a generic target
cannot infer delivery semantics, so you must say what makes a delivery
"the same one."

### `csv/deliver`

Writes delivered records to a CSV: `identity_key` plus the `variables:`
targets as columns (sorted, header written once, rows appended across
runs). Universal output to anything with an import button, and the
natural human-review artifact. Re-runs append nothing — idempotency holds
records back before the adapter is invoked.

## The example external adapter

### `mock-enrich-py`

A ~40-line Python script proving the process-adapter boundary is real:
reads the NDJSON protocol on stdin, adds a `mock.score` field, exits.
Installed to `~/.gtme/adapters/` by `install.sh`. If you're writing a
process adapter in any language, start by reading it.

## Adding your own

Drop a `binding.yaml` (plus `fixtures/conformance.json`) into
`~/.gtme/adapters/<name>/` and the id resolves immediately — no build, no
restart. The [getting-started tutorial](https://www.elegantatomics.com/blog/getting-started-with-gtme)
walks authoring one against a live API; [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
has the checklist for bindings worth sharing.
